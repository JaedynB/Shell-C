About This Project:
This project is a shell script written in C which is intended to allow users the ability to run basic commands from their terminal. Commands include 'ls', 'cd', 'history', 'echo', 'touch', '!n', 'listpids', and 'quit'. 

For the command '!n', the program accepts up to n = 15 for the 15 most recent commands written by the user.
